This is My first attempt at writing HTML, here I'm just adding headings, tables, ordered lists and unordered lists to see what the changes are

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 
<!-- Metadata goes in the head  -->
	<title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>

<!-- Content goes in the body  -->
<h1>This is heading one</h1>
<h2>This is heading two</h2>
<h3>This is heading three</h3>

<!--This is an image-->

<!--Inserting a Link-->
<a href="http://www.google.com">Click Here to go to GOOGLE</a>	

<!--Inserting a 2nd Page/ "Relative Path" / a 2nd page of your own content-->
<a href="page2.html">Go To Page 2</a>

What is Lorem Ipsum?
Lorem Ipsum is <strong>simply dummy text</strong> of the printing and typesetting industry. <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
