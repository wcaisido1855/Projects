Welcome! Thanks for checking out my GitHub Repositories! I'm still getting the hang of file and folder creation and moving around, so please bear with the weird numbering conventions ans I move things around.

The First repository is my collection of file relate to my course project - known as a "Capstone Project" for the Introduction to Data Science Course I completed from SpringBoard.com. This Project is basically a thesis paper that was required to complete the 100 hour course. This repository is all the wokr that led up to my final completed project. I didn't know about version control back then unfortunately, so most of those files are almost the same as the current final project, seeing as I didn't post them until I had the final part of each section completed instead of editing and saving changes as I went.
