Welcome! Thanks for checking out my GitHub Repositories! I'm still getting the hang of file and folder creation and moving around, so please bear with the weird numbering conventions as I move things around.

1) The 1st repository - Capstone Project is my collection of files related to my course project - known as a "Capstone Project" for the "Introduction to Data Science Course" paid bootcamp I completed through SpringBoard.com. This Project is basically a thesis paper that was required to complete the 100 hour course. This repository is all the wokr that led up to my final completed project. I didn't know about version control back then unfortunately, so most of those files are almost the same as the current final project, seeing as I didn't post them until I had the final part of each section completed instead of editing and saving changes as I went. *Note* My final Project is not in that folder, it is in another folder detailed below.

2) The 2nd repository - Foundations of Data Science Coursework, is the repository of all of the code for the required coursework for the "Introduction to Data Science" course I completed through SpringBoard.com. I'll be honest, most fo the code there is pretty rough since those were my beginning attempts at learning how to code in R language. 

3) The 3rd repository - Python Projects is the repository of my current Python Projects I'm working on. A lot of them are cool little tutorials from Siraj Raval's Youtube Channel (My favorite being "Hot to build a Neural Net in 9 lines of code" showing that such an advanced concept can actually be carried out very simply. His amazing videos and tutorials can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A/playlists

4) The 4th repository - R Projects is the repository of my current Projects in R. These include a Neural Net for binary classifcation of objects that are either "Hot Dog" or "Not Hot Dog" inspired by an episode of Silicon Valley, as well as a program that creates Manadala Objects in R using a few neat little math tricks ^_^

5) The 5th repository -HTML, CSS, JS Projects is my repository of front-end Web Development projects. Here are all of the tutorial files and website attempts I'm working on from a couple of Udemy courses on Web Development. 

<p>I'm currently working through two courses:

<p>The Web Development Bootcamp by Colt Steele (Very in depth on each and every single element):

and 

Learn To Build Beautiful HTML5 And CSS3 Websites In 1 Month by Ryan Bonhardt (Not as in depth, but definitel more focused on "doing" as much as possible as quickly as possible to build up experience):
https://www.udemy.com/learn-to-build-beautiful-html5-and-css3-websites-in-1-month/learn/v4/overview


6) The 6th Repository (Not numbered)- Capstone Project/Final Project is the fodler conatining all of the Final Draft documents of my Capston Project, which I'm super proud of: "A Data Driven Approach to Investing in P2P Lending Platforms" where I used Machine learning to determine the most highly correlated variables to Loan Chargeoffs in Lending Club's publicly published loan data.  ^_^
